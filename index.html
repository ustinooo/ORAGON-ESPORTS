				<h3>Team Composition and Roles</h3>
				<p>Ensure that each player is skilled in their respective roles. For example, in games like League of Legends, you need players specializing in specific positions like top lane, mid lane, ADC, support, and jungle.
				Chemistry and Communication: The ability to communicate effectively and work well together is crucial. Team chemistry can often be the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
